# Dockerized Project with Astro.js and Directus Backend

This project is a dockerized website that uses Astro.js as the frontend framework and Directus as the backend CMS.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the cloned repository.

### Directus

#### Dashboard
- You can access to directus dashboard from `http://directus.localhost` url.
- You can find/set `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` variables `/docker/develop/envs/directus.env` file for your admin login.

#### Database
- Database tables are named as collection in directus.
- You can create new collection from `Settings > Data Model` menu.

#### User Permissions
You need to create a user from `Users` menu. Then you need to create new role from `Settings > Access Control` menu and get your `access token`.<br><br>
This access token will be used for requesting directus API. (`http://directus.localhost/items/:collection`)

** You can manage collection CRUD permissions inside roles settings.

### Astro

â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ i18n/

â”‚   â””â”€â”€ stores/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ store.ts
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
